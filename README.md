# StepsList

The `StepsList` is a custom Markdown extension designed to convert `<steps>` tags into ordered lists with a class of "steps". This is particularly useful for formatting step-by-step instructions or processes in a consistent and visually appealing manner.

## Installation

To use the `StepsList`, you need to have Python and the `markdown` library installed. You can install the `markdown` library using pip:

```bash
pip install markdown
```

Once you have the `markdown` library, you can include the `StepsList` in your project by copying the `stepslist.py` file into your project directory.

## Usage

To use the `StepsList`, you need to register it with your Markdown instance. Here is a simple example:

```python
from markdown import Markdown
from extensions.stepslist import StepsList

md = Markdown(extensions=[StepsList()])

input_text = """
<steps>
Step 1
Step 2
Step 3
</steps>
"""

html_output = md.convert(input_text)
print(html_output)
```

This will convert the `<steps>` block into an HTML ordered list:

```html
<ol class="steps">
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <li>Step 3</li>
</ol>
```

## Configuration

The `StepsList` does not require any specific configuration options. It is designed to work out-of-the-box by converting any `<steps>` tags found in the markdown text into ordered lists.

## Conclusion

The `StepsList` is a simple yet powerful tool for enhancing the readability and structure of step-by-step instructions in markdown documents. For further assistance or to contribute to the project, please refer to the project's repository or contact the maintainers.

Feel free to explore and modify the extension to suit your specific needs!
